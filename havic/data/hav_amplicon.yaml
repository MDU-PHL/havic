FORCE_OVERWRITE_AND_RE_RUN:
  Yes # Yes for full re-run, No to start from an interrupted run,

DEFAULT_SUBJECT:
  Yes # Yes if using havic pre-packaged SUBJECT (i.e., "reference") sequence and region test data, No otherwise

DEFAULT_QUERIES:
  Yes # Yes if using havic pre-packaged QUERY test data, No otherwise

SUBJECT_FILE: # the "SUBJECT" sequence in BLAST terms, i.e., reference genome
  data/NC_001489.fa # relative or absolute paths to fasta file
  # if DEFAULT_SUBJECT is Yes, path will be prefixed to use pre-packaged data

SUBJECT_TARGET_REGION: # the target region of the genome to focus on
  data/havnet_amplicon.fa # in fasta format, relative or absolute paths okay
  # if DEFAULT_SUBJECT is Yes, path will be prefixed to use pre-packaged data

OUTDIR: # the parent directory for the results folders
  havic_test_results/hav_amplicon # relative or absolute path to parent result folder

TREE_ROOT:
  midpoint # sequence name to root iqtree on, or midpoint for midpoint root

RUN_PREFIX:
  HAV_amplicon_

PLOTS:
  Yes # Yes to make plots (slow for large runs), No otherwise.

MAPPER_SETTINGS:
  executable:

  other:
    -c --cs --secondary=no
  k_mer: # select an odd number, between 3 and 27 inclusive
    -k 5 # 5 has been good for the HAV amplicon seqs, adjust sensibly

IQTREE2_SETTINGS: # http://www.iqtree.org/doc/iqtree-doc.pdf

  coarse_subtree_support: # divide tree into subtrees at/above this threshold
    70
  fine_cluster_support: # branch support minimum value for clusters of tips
