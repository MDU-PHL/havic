FORCE_OVERWRITE_AND_RE_RUN:
  Yes # Yes for full re-run, No to start from an interrupted run,

DEFAULT_SUBJECT:
  Yes # Yes if using havic pre-packaged SUBJECT (i.e., "reference") sequence and region test data, No otherwise

DEFAULT_QUERIES:
  Yes # Yes if using havic pre-packaged QUERY test data, No otherwise

SUBJECT_FILE: # the "SUBJECT" sequence in BLAST terms, i.e., reference genome
  data/NC_001489.fa # relative or absolute paths to fasta file
  # if DEFAULT_SUBJECT is Yes, path will be prefixed to use pre-packaged data

SUBJECT_TARGET_REGION: # the target region of the genome to focus on
  data/havnet_amplicon.fa # in fasta format, relative or absolute paths okay
  # if DEFAULT_SUBJECT is Yes, path will be prefixed to use pre-packaged data
