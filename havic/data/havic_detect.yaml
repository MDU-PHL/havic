  Yes # Yes if using havic pre-packaged QUERY test data, No otherwise

SUBJECT_FILE: # the "SUBJECT" sequence in BLAST terms, i.e., reference genome
  data/NC_001489.fa # relative or absolute paths to fasta file
  # if DEFAULT_REFS is Yes, path will be prefixed to use pre-packaged data

SUBJECT_AMPLICON: # the amplicon sequence, with primers excluded
  data/havnet_amplicon.fa # in fasta format, relative or absolute paths okay
  # if DEFAULT_REFS is Yes, path will be prefixed to use pre-packaged data

OUTDIR: # the parent directory for the results folders
  havic_test_results # relative or absolute path to parent result folder

PLOTS:
  Yes # Yes to make plots (slow for large runs), No otherwise.
